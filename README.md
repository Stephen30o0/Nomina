Nomina
Description

Nomina is a mobile Augmented Reality (AR) language learning application that helps users learn new languages by connecting words directly to real-world objects. By pointing a smartphone camera at everyday objects, users can instantly view the object’s name in a selected language along with pronunciation support, making language learning more contextual, intuitive, and engaging.

Nomina focuses on active learning through real-world interaction, allowing learners to associate vocabulary with physical objects instead of relying on memorization-based methods. This repository contains the initial MVP prototype designed to demonstrate core AR interaction, user interface design, and learning flow.

Project Track

AR/VR Track

Project Scope (MVP)

This version of Nomina represents an early-stage prototype and focuses on:

Augmented reality interaction using a mobile device camera

Real-time object labeling in a selected language

Pronunciation playback for scanned objects

Simple vocabulary saving and review

Clear and minimal user interface optimized for AR

Advanced features such as gamification, analytics, and backend services are outside the scope of this MVP.

User Flow

User launches the application

User selects a target language

The camera opens in AR scanning mode

User points the camera at a real-world object

The object is detected and highlighted

An AR label appears showing the object name in the selected language

User taps the audio icon to hear pronunciation

User can save the word for later review

Saved words can be viewed in the vocabulary list

Design & Prototype

The user interface and interaction flow were designed using Figma, with a focus on:

Camera-first layout

Minimal and non-intrusive AR overlays

Clear navigation and interaction feedback

Accessibility and readability over live camera feed
